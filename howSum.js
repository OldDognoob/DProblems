// Write a function `howSum(targetSum, numbers)` that takes in a targetSum and 
//an array of numbers as arguments.
// However, this function should return an array containing any combination
// of elements that add up to exactly the targetSum. If there is no combination that
// adds up to the targetSum, then return null.

// if there are multiple combinations possible, you may return any single one.

//Methodology Approach
// This exercise is almost the same but here I want to return a combination of numbers 
// that leads to the targetSum.
