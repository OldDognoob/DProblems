// Lets say that we are traveling on a 2D grid. We begin in the top-left
// corner and our target is to travel to the bottom-right corner.
// We can only move down or right.(no other moves to do)

// In how many ways can you travel to the target on a grid with dimensions m * n?
// your function gridTraveler(m,n) will calculate this trip.

//Methodology Approach
// 1. if our function is gridTraveler(2,3) means how we will travel in a grid with dimensions
// 2 by 3? There are 3 ways to travel.
// 3. if the function is griTraveler(1,1) means there is 1 way of traveling
// 4. And if the function is gridTraveler(0,1) or(1,0) or(0,0) then means the grid is empty.
//5. Lets calculate now gridTraveler(3,3) so we want to travel in a grid with dimensions 3 by 3
//
